  	<p>Some of the major types of commonly prescribed cardiovascular medications are summarized in this section. For your information and reference, we have included generic names as well as major trade names to help you identify what you may be taking. However, the AHA is not recommending or endorsing any specific products. If your prescription medication isn't on this list, remember that your healthcare provider and pharmacist are your best sources of information. It's important to discuss all of the drugs you take with your provider and understand their desired effects and possible side effects. Never stop taking a medication and never change your dose or frequency without first consulting the prescribing doctor.</p>

<li>Background:Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, and multiple medications are often needed to control symptoms and risk factors. Little research has explored the cost of medications for a typical patient with chronic ischemic heart disease. We undertook a study to determine the cost of medications and how they are paid for by patients in one rural clinic.</li><br>

<li>Methods: One hundred four patients met criteria for chronic ischemic heart disease. We obtained patient information, risk factors, and current medications using retrospective chart reviews. We then calculated usual and customary costs per month for each of the 355 cardiac and 214 noncardiac prescriptions. After we determined which patients qualified for third party reimbursement or the community health center medication discount program, we calculated the actual out-of-pocket cost to the patient for each prescription.</li><br>

<li>Results: Average monthly medication costs were $104.77 for cardiac medications and $115.54 for noncardiac medications, for a total of $220.31. Patients were reimbursed for approximately 64 percent of the total medications costs, making average out-of-pocket medication costs $41.52 for cardiac medications and $36.86 for noncardiac medications, for a total of $78.38. Seventy-one percent of patients were reimbursed by their insurance company, 19 percent qualified for the medication discount program, and 10 percent had no assistance. Patient risk factors included positive family history of chronic ischemic heart disease (71 percent), hypertension (64 percent), history of smoking (61 percent), currently smoking (26 percent), diabetes (25 percent), and recently elevated cholesterol levels (67 percent of 76 patients).</li><br>

<li>Conclusions: Medication costs for patients with chronic ischemic heart disease are expensive and burdensome. Third party payers and the medication discount program relieved a considerable (64 percent) but inadequate amount of prescription costs. Multiple risk factors coexist with these medication costs. Patient behavior modification and an aggressive approach to risk reduction might reduce these costs.</li><br></p></article>
